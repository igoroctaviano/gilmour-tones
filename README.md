These settings should only be used as a starting point since the sound will vary depending on the type of speakers used. He have two of the inputs linked to combine the Normal and Brilliant channels, but he tend to keep the Brill channel volume lower than the Normal.

There's are actual studio Hiwatt DR-103 settings from the Dark Side of the Moon through The Wall era. The upper normal input and lower brilliant inputs were internally linked, which is why there is a dummy plug in the upper left input.

```
Based on the tic marks shown in the photos taken by Pete Cornish when he worked on the amps prior to the tour. The upper normal input and lower brilliant inputs are internally linked. Photos of the amp settings from the tour vary only slightly form these settings. Note that one DR-103 head poweried a Marshall 4x12 speaker cabinet, and another a WEM 4x12 speaker cabinet. Settings were identical except the bass was set slightly higher for the WEM cabinet (gray line). 

Your Hiwatt settings will vary depending on the cabinet type, speaker type, and number of speakers used, so this should only be used as a starting point for your own settings.

This is the same amp chassis and the DR103 head, just mounted upside down in the combo, so the inputs are upside down, but David's 212 inputs appear to be linked as if they were right side up, the same as David's Hiwatt heads. They may have been internally linked the same as the heads, but re-wired so that the upper right input is the linked input, since David is familiar with using that one on his Hiwatt heads.

```
He found the Normal, high gain input seems to work best for Gilmour clean and light overdrive tones, but the Bright channel works much better with Big Muffs, or when combining with a Hiwatt. 

If you are plugged into one channel, adjusting the volume of the unused channel affects the volume and tone of the other. In this application, it is best to keep the unused channel volume off. He keep the volume around 3-4.

He experimented linking the inputs on my 59 Bassman but I prefer the sound of only the bright input 1.

Keep in mind that all effect settings and setups are based on pictures and video from a certain date and/or interviews and 3rd hand transcriptions that are subject to interpretation. David often make adjustments and may not even be consequent in how he’s using the equipment. This feature should therefore only be used as a guideline for your own setup and not as a gospel. It’s also wise to acknowledge that technique, place and time, studio trickery and who knows what plays a role in David’s tones in addition to the equipment.
